Perceptron
Implementation of single perceptron algorithm. File 'TrainingSet' contains training
data and 'TestData' - test data.
Learning algorithm:
0. set all weights and threshold to small random numbers
1. for each case in training data:
-calculate output of perceptron
-update weights and threshold according to perceptron learning rule
2. repeat step 1 until specified number of iterations is completed.
3. calculate accuracy on the test set.

User has possibility to provide:
- learning parameter
- number of iterations
- and testing new examples
