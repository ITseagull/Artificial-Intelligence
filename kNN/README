K-nearest-neighbours
Implementation of k-nearest-meighbours algoruthm. File "TrainingSet" cases from
training set. File "TestData" contains cases from test set. Algorithm uses the data from training set to
classify each case from the test set.
Euclidean distance metric was used. K number is provided by user.
For each example from test set printed: label of a class predicted by the algorithm and class label provided
in test set. Computation of accuracy. 

Example:
Predicted Test
Iris-setosa Iris-setosa
Iris-setosa Iris-setosa
Iris-setosa Iris-versicolor
